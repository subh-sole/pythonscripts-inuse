      Title: Converting TIFF Images to JPEG using Python
      
      Introduction:
      This documentation explains how to use Python code to convert TIFF images to JPEG format in a specified folder. It utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to open, convert, and save the images. The script is designed to replace the original TIFF files with their corresponding JPEG versions after the conversion process.
      
      Requirements:
      To run the code, you need the following:
      
      Python installed on your system.
      The Python Imaging Library (PIL), which can be installed using pip with the command pip install pillow.
      Code Description:
      The provided Python script defines a function called convert_tif_to_jpeg that takes a folder path as input. The function then iterates through all files in the specified folder and converts any TIFF images to JPEG format.
